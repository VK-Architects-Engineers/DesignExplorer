# DesignExplorer

This is a modified version of design explorer to be used inside the VK / SWECO ecosystem.
You can find the open-source tool [here](https://tt-acm.github.io/DesignExplorer/)


> Design Explore is a web application to make exploring multi-dimensional design space enjoying and meaningful!

## What has been modified
Apart from some layout changes (removal of divs and source file options) we have modified how the app handles the user data file.
Essentially, the app is expecting a fileshare to exist with the data files required to have the app run.


## Design Explorer is built on top of these plugins and web technologies:
### [Bootstrap template with side bar](http://getbootstrap.com/)
### [D3 Parallel coordinates](https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/)
